# GitHub bsics for College Projects
  GitHub is one of the most widely used platforms for version control, which is a key skill for software engineering. Learning how to use GitHub will allow CSE students to keep track of changes to their code, collaborate with others, and recover from errors if necessary.
My Goals With Github:- It'll help me to make group projects, as now interacting live on a same code is possible for me. So I'll create group projects on github.
I'll use it with my friends and search more about it on internet annd wherever possible to be comfortable with its environment, so that i can easily create and participate in group projects and much more.
